# ATM Simulation in Java

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple **ATM simulation** implemented in Java.
It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as:

* Checking account balance
* Withdrawing money
* Depositing money

The program also validates a user PIN before granting access to ATM functionalities.
